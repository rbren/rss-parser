        "contentSnippet": "After November 2016, all releases of the Google Ads API Java Client Library will only be compatible with Java 7 (1.7) and higher. Why this change is happeningThe primary reasons for this change are:    Java 6 is a bit outdated -- it was first introduced in Dec 2006, and Oracle's support for Java 6 is approaching some key end dates.  Maintaining support for Java 6 means code examples cannot leverage useful features of Java 7, such as catch clauses for multiple exception types and type inference for generic instance creation.  Usage of Java 6 among Google Ads API Java Client Library developers is rapidly declining. Next stepsIf you are using Java 7 or higher, then no action is required.

MutateJobService has been removed in v201603, so be sure to check out the migration information if you have not yet transitioned to BatchJobService.  Targeting extensions. Extension setting services now support setting campaign, ad group, keyword, and location targeting for each ExtensionFeedItem, as shown in the updated code examples.  Reporting improvements. Ad group bid modifiers are now available via the new AdGroupMobileBidModifier field in the ADGROUP_PERFORMANCE_REPORT report. Null values will appear as two dashes (--) for String fields in all reports. If you’re using v201509 of the AdWords API, please note that it’s now deprecated and will be sunset on June 21st, 2016. We encourage you to skip v201601 and migrate straight to v201603. As with every new version of the AdWords API, we encourage you to carefully review all changes in the release notes and the v201603 migration guide. The updated client libraries and code examples will be published shortly. With this release, we’ve also updated the Required Minimum Functionality document to include some of the newly added features. If you have any questions or need help with migration, please post on the forum or the Ads Developers Plus Page.  - Josh Radcliff on behalf of the AdWords API Team",

If you’re using v201506 of the AdWords API, please note that it’s being sunset on April 11th, 2016 as previously announced. We encourage you to skip v201509 and migrate straight to v201601. As with every new version of the AdWords API, we encourage you to carefully review all changes in the release notes and the v201601 migration guide. The updated client libraries and code examples will be published shortly. With this release, we’ve also updated the Required Minimum Functionality document to include some of the newly added features. If you have any questions or need help with migration, please post on the forum or the Ads Developers Plus Page.   - Josh Radcliff on behalf of the AdWords API Team.",

Starting at the end of January 2016, API releases will occur at the end of every alternate month, continuing through March, May, July, and September. We will reassess the cost and benefits of this release schedule to the developer community throughout the experiment and determine whether to continue with it or fall back to the current three-times-a-year schedule.<br /><br />We believe that delivering API releases more frequently will help you, the API users, get quicker access to AdWords innovations for making continuous improvements to your tools and platforms.<br /><br />Each of these releases will be considered a major release and will trigger the deprecation of the oldest outstanding major release.

With the new release schedule, we will support 3 releases concurrently at any given time and 4 releases for a brief period of 4 weeks to accommodate developers who want to skip <b>two</b> major releases entirely.

        "contentSnippet": "Did you know that you can reach past website visitors and app users? Let's say you’re a travel brand. You can now reach people who have joined your rewards program as they plan their next trip. For example, when these rewards members search for “non-stop flights to new york” on Google.com, you can show relevant ads at the top of their search results on any device right when they’re looking to fly to New York. And when those members are watching their favorite videos on YouTube or catching up on Gmail, you can show ads that inspire them to plan their next trip. Behind the scenes, this works by adding people to a UserList.   Prior to v201509 there were four different types:  BasicUserList: Remarketing to people who took specific actions (such as purchasing shoes) on your website or app.  RuleBasedUserList: Remarketing to people who follow advertiser-defined rules. The rule can be as simple as all visitors to your website (which is the easiest way to start remarketing).  LogicalUserList: Combining two or more user lists. For example, customers who purchased shoes and/or visited specific pages of your website at specific times.  SimilarUserList: Remarketing to people that share similar interests and behaviors with those in other user lists. For example, you can reach new potential customers that share similar interests and behaviors with those who purchased shoes on your website. A SimilarUserList is automatically created by Google for each UserList based on a variety of factors, such as the number of people on the original list, how recently these people joined the original list, the types of sites that these people browsed and whether the original list is your own. This process may take up to 4 days once the seed list is created. You can target or exclude user lists at the ad group level, but you can only exclude them at the campaign level. As a reminder, please have a look at the policy for advertising based on interests and location and the policy for remarketing lists for search ads.   Customer Match v201509 introduced a new user list type: CrmBasedUserList. It enables you to create a user list using your customers’ email addresses. Suppose you have an existing database of email addresses of your newsletter subscribers for “people who love shoes”. With a CrmBasedUserList you can reach these subscribers and adjust your bidding accordingly, present different ads, and more. You can use a SimilarUserList of your subscribers list to potentially find new customers who share similar behaviors and interests. Each CrmBasedUserList must have an optOutLink to provide a link to the page where people can manage their preferences for receiving email messages from the advertiser, including opting out of the advertiser email messages. Before using this targeting strategy, please take the time to read our policy page.   A CrmBasedUserList can be used for targeting on the Search network, YouTube and Gmail, whereas a SimilarUserList of a CrmBasedUserList can only be used for targeting on YouTube and Gmail. Keep the following points in mind when using a CrmBasedUserList: Advertisers must collect email addresses as 1st party. For example, an agency can submit email addresses on behalf of an advertiser if the advertiser collected the email addresses directly from its customers.  Email addresses can be from Gmail or non Gmail addresses as long as they are associated with a Google account. We recommend adding all available email addresses to maximize the size of the result.  Ads will serve only when the user list has at least 1,000 active members. Active members are those who have used Google Search, YouTube, or Gmail at least once over the last 30 days. If you want to read more about CrmBasedUserList, have a look at our guide and code examples. As always, feel free to visit us or ask questions on the AdWords API Forum or our Google+ page.

Recently, AdWords introduced new columns called <a href=\"https://plus.sandbox.google.com/+GoogleAds/posts/SxjMpNVyfYW\">Engagements</a> and <a href=\"http://adwords.blogspot.com/2015/09/new-reporting-columns-for-multi-channel.html\">Interactions</a>. It also added reporting columns related to video campaigns such as <code>VideoViews</code>, which have previously been unavailable via API reporting. <b>AdWords API version v201509 has updated its reporting to match these changes.</b><br /><br /> The new <code>Interactions</code> field, available in API performance reports, can be thought of as the main action a user takes with the ad format: clicks for text ads, engagements for Lightbox ads, and views for video ads. Previously, views for video ads were not returned in API reporting, so having access to this data is new.<br /><br /> Prior to v201509, the <code>Clicks</code> field always included both clicks and engagements. Starting in v201509, the <code>Clicks</code> field includes only click actions, like clickthroughs to a landing page or clicks to call. This means that clicks on video ads, which are unpaid, will be included in this field. However, engagements for Lightbox ads <b>will not</b> be counted.<br /><br /> If measuring performance across multiple ad formats, you might consider using <code>Interactions</code> to view the total number of primary user actions on ads, all in the same column. <code>Clicks</code>, <code>Engagements</code>, and <code>VideoViews</code> are available as well for more fine-grained reporting by ad format.<br /><br /> The table below summarizes the changes in each field for various ad formats.<br /><br /> <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

        "contentSnippet": "AdWords API v201509 introduces some changes to reporting columns, particularly Clicks. Recently, AdWords introduced new columns called Engagements and Interactions. It also added reporting columns related to video campaigns such as VideoViews, which have previously been unavailable via API reporting. AdWords API version v201509 has updated its reporting to match these changes. The new Interactions field, available in API performance reports, can be thought of as the main action a user takes with the ad format: clicks for text ads, engagements for Lightbox ads, and views for video ads. Previously, views for video ads were not returned in API reporting, so having access to this data is new. Prior to v201509, the Clicks field always included both clicks and engagements. Starting in v201509, the Clicks field includes only click actions, like clickthroughs to a landing page or clicks to call. This means that clicks on video ads, which are unpaid, will be included in this field. However, engagements for Lightbox ads will not be counted. If measuring performance across multiple ad formats, you might consider using Interactions to view the total number of primary user actions on ads, all in the same column. Clicks, Engagements, and VideoViews are available as well for more fine-grained reporting by ad format. The table below summarizes the changes in each field for various ad formats.   Field  v201506  v201509ClicksText ads: clickthrough to a landing pageLightbox ads: hover to expanded ad format Text ads: clickthrough to a landing page or clicks to callLightbox ads: clickthrough to a landing pageVideo ads: clickthrough to a landing page EngagementsN/A Lightbox ads: hover to expanded ad format VideoViewsN/A Video ads: view InteractionsN/A Text ads: clickthrough to a landing page or clicks to callLightbox ads: hover to expanded ad formatVideo ads: views  Please note that reporting in v201506 and previous versions is unaffected; they return the same data that they always have, represented the same way. This means that when comparing the data you receive from older versions of the API to user interface reports, or to v201509 reports, the numbers will not directly match up. Video-related stats will still be excluded from v201506. The Clicks column in v201506 will match the Interactions column from v201509 if you subtract out video interactions. For ease of reporting, it’s recommended to migrate to v201509 as soon as possible. Keep in mind these aren’t the only reporting changes in v201509 — for more details on conversion-related reporting changes, please see the release notes.

An ad group-level CPA bid is inactive if the ad group's effective bidding strategy is not a <code>CONVERSION_OPTIMIZER</code> strategy. This includes CPA bids on ad groups whose effective bidding strategy is <code>TARGET_CPA</code>, since the target for such ad groups is specified at the strategy level.
